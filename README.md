# ML-projects


Welcome to the ML Projects repository! This repository contains the following projects:

1. [Seattle Biker Predictor](seattle_biker_predictor.ipynb): A predictive analysis of Seattle bicycle counts using machine learning.

2. [Titanic Survival Prediction](titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb): A machine learning project predicting survival on the Titanic based on passenger information.

3. [Deep Learning EMNIST Classifier](deep_Learning_EMNIST_Classifier_Q3.ipynb): A deep learning project using convolutional neural networks to classify characters in the EMNIST dataset.

## Project Descriptions

### Seattle Biker Predictor
- Analyzes Seattle bicycle count data.
- Uses LinearRegression to predict future bike counts.
- Includes data exploration, feature engineering, and model training.

### Titanic Survival Prediction
- Predicts survival on the Titanic based on passenger features.
- Involves exploratory data analysis and model building.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for classification (LogisticRegression ).

### Deep Learning EMNIST Classifier
- Implements a deep learning model to classify characters in the EMNIST dataset.
- Involves preprocessing, model architecture definition, training, and evaluation.
- Uses convolutional neural networks for image classification.

## How to Use
Each project is contained in its respective Jupyter Notebook. Follow the instructions within each notebook to run the analysis and reproduce the results.
